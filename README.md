This is the final submission code base for the "CSE597 - Vision and Language" course.

NOTE: Running this code base is expensive and colab pro or colab pro+ is needed. A100 GPU is preffered as the runs take approximately 5-6 hours per notebook.

Instructions:
- Download the data from the parent repo https://github.com/cnedwards/text2mol/tree/master/data
- Store the data in a folder named "data".
- Run the notebooks in the sequence mentioned in the README.txt file of notebooks directory.
- In the notebooks, pay attention to the directory paths that are required. Create the directories whereever required.
